This is a slight modified copy of http://code.dunae.ca/acts_as_slugable/. It uses rails .parameterize instead of custom functions.

Installation:

./script/plugin install git://github.com/mantas/acts_as_slugable.git

Usage:

=== With scope

  class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_slugable :source_column => :title, :target_column => :url_slug, :scope => :parent
  end

=== Without scope

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_slugable :source_column => :title, :target_column => :url_slug
  end

== Credits

Thanks to Philip Hallstrom (http://pjkh.com/) for pointing out some redundant code.
